The pizza ordering system is single page website for pizza ordring module.
In the website we are fetching the available pizza details from server/pizza.json.After
click  we are adding the selected pizza with different sizes and multiple qautity
and the  order is placed and a success message is displayed. 


To run the project in chrome need to follow the following steps

1. Close chromeif already open.
1. open cmd
2. Go to chrome folder in program files
3. run "chrome --allow-file-access-from-files file:///C:/Users/Oshin/Desktop/PizzaOrderingSystem/OrderList.html"
otherwise you can use IE.
Because We are not opening the page through a server, like Apache, so when the browser tries to obtain the resource it thinks it is from a separate domain,
 which is not allowed.
